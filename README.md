* Download the EBV (HHV4) consensus genome sequence

* Download the EBV annotated genes. Note: this geneset is not perfect and is meant primarily as means of visualization and coarse summary. It is strongly recommended that you also download the original GenBank file if you want to obtain a more complete picture of the EBV coding regions.

* Download our scripts for removing human reads and visualization

* Download the Bowtie alignment package

* Create a bowtie index (bowtie-build ebv.fa ebv) and fasta index (samtools faidx ebv.fa.fai)
